Don't forget that:
	- you worked on very little number of images(6)
	- the function stereoCalibrate() doesn't work fine, it shouldn't change the values of intrinsic params that
		are passed, there is a problem with the flag usage.
	- there's another thing that I don't remember
		- remembered one thing, I need to continue the video then apply to get the disparity map
